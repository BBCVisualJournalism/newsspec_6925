In five countries and in regions of two others&#44; homosexuality is still punishable with the death penalty, while others imprison or fine citizens because of their sexual orientation.","CPS intro line 2":"Even where homosexuality is legal&#44; many countries treat those in same-sex relationships differently, such as having an unequal age of consent or a ban on marriage. In Russia, host of the Sochi Winter Olympics, a law banning the promotion of \"non-traditional\" sexuality to under-18s was introduced last year.","CPS intro line 3":"So&#44; where is it illegal to be gay?

At the other end, there are those countries where gay couples have the same marriage rights as heterosexual couples.","maptext2":"However&#44; the categorisation of countries according to their approach to gay rights is not without problems.

After period of criminalisation before the French Revolution in 1789, the trend towards decriminalisation gathered pace - particularly in the 1960s and 1970s.","CPS timeline intro text - line 2":"However&#44; some countries are moving in the opposite direction, introducing punitive new laws and strengthening existing penalties. Last year, India reinstated a 153-year-old colonial-era law criminalising gay sex. Nigeria, which already bans gay relationships, also recently outlawed same-sex marriages, gay groups and shows of same-sex public affection.","CPS timeline intro text - line 3":"Olympic host Russia also introduced controversial legislation in June that prescribes fines for anyone giving information about homosexuality to people under 18.","s":"Critics say the amendment's loose wording&#44; and its free interpretation by the authorities, effectively make any kind of public gay rights event in Russia impossible. However, President Vladimir Putin has insisted the new law does not harm anybody and that gay people face no discrimination at work or in society in Russia.","CPS timeline title":"Legal status of homosexuality: 1789-2014","all":"All","filter_by":"Filter by","CPS timeline subtitle":"In 1789&#44; the timeline's starting point, homosexuality was illegal in 126 countries","totalCountriesStart":"126 countries","timeline_header1":"Criminalised","timeline_header2":"Date","timeline_header3":"Decriminalised","Timeline country names":"","AFG":"Afghanistan","ALB":"Albania","DZA":"Algeria","AND":"Andorra","AGO":"Angola","ATG":"Antigua and Barbuda","ARG":"Argentina","ARM":"Armenia","AUS":"Australia","AUT":"Austria","AZE":"Azerbaijan","BHS":"Bahamas","BHR":"Bahrain","BGD":"Bangladesh","BRB":"Barbados","BLR":"Belarus","BEL":"Belgium","BLZ":"Belize","BTN":"Bhutan","BIH":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","BWA":"Botswana","BRA":"Brazil","BRN":"Brunei","BGR":"Bulgaria","BDI":"Burundi","CMR":"Cameroon","CAN":"Canada","CPV":"Cape Verde","CHL":"Chile","CHN":"China","COL":"Colombia","COM":"Comoros","CRI":"Costa Rica","HRV":"Croatia","CUB":"Cuba","CYP":"Cyprus","CZE":"Czech Republic","CSK":"Czechoslovakia","DNK":"Denmark","DJI":"Djibouti","DMA":"Dominica","DOM":"Dominican Republic","DDR":"East Germany","ECU":"Ecuador","EGY":"Egypt","ERI":"Eritrea","EST":"Estonia","ETH":"Ethiopia","FJI":"Fiji","FIN":"Finland","FRA":"France","GMB":"Gambia","GEO":"Georgia","DEUE":"German Empire","GHA":"Ghana","GRC":"Greece","GRD":"Grenada","GIN":"Guinea","GNB":"Guinea Bissau","GUY":"Guyana","HTI":"Haiti","HND":"Honduras","HKG":"Hong Kong","HUN":"Hungary","ISL":"Iceland","IND":"India","IRN":"Iran","IRL":"Ireland","ISR":"Israel","ITA":"Italy","JAM":"Jamaica","JOR":"Jordan","KAZ":"Kazakhstan","KEN":"Kenya","KIR":"Kiribati","KWT":"Kuwait","KGZ":"Kyrgyzstan","LVA":"Latvia","LBN":"Lebanon","LSO":"Lesotho","LBR":"Liberia","LBY":"Libya","LIE":"Liechtenstein","LTU":"Lithuania","LUX":"Luxembourg","MKD":"Macedonia","MWI":"Malawi","MYS":"Malaysia","MDV":"Maldives","MLT":"Malta","MHL":"Marshall Islands","MRT":"Mauritania","MUS":"Mauritius","MEX":"Mexico","MDA":"Moldova","MCO":"Monaco","MNG":"Mongolia","MNE":"Montenegro","MAR":"Morocco","MOZ":"Mozambique","MMR":"Myanmar","NAM":"Namibia","NRU":"Nauru","NPL":"Nepal","NLD":"Netherlands","NZL":"New Zealand","NIC":"Nicaragua","NGA":"Nigeria","NOR":"Norway","OMN":"Oman","PAK":"Pakistan","PLW":"Palau","PAN":"Panama","PNG":"Papua New Guinea","PRY":"Paraguay","PER":"Peru","POL":"Poland","PRT":"Portugal","PRS":"Prussia (Germany)","QAT":"Qatar","ROU":"Romania","RUS":"Russia*","RUSE":"Russian Empire","WSM":"Western Samoa","SMR":"San Marino","STP":"Sao Tome and Principe","SAU":"Saudi Arabia","SEN":"Senegal","SRB":"Serbia","SYC":"Seyshelles","SLE":"Sierra Leone","SGP":"Singapore","SVK":"Slovakia","SVN":"Slovenia","SLB":"Solomon Islands","SOM":"Somalia","ZAF":"South Africa","ESP":"Spain","LKA":"Sri Lanka","KNA":"Saint Kitts and Nevis","LCA":"Saint Lucia","VCT":"St Vincent & the Grenadines","SDN":"Sudan","SUR":"Suriname","SWZ":"Swaziland","SWE":"Sweden","CHE":"Switzerland","SYR":"Syria","TWN":"Taiwan","TJK":"Tajikistan","TZA":"Tanzania","THA":"Thailand","TLS":"Timor Leste","TGO":"Togo","TON":"Tonga","TTO":"Trinidad and Tobago","TUN":"Tunisia","TUR":"Turkey","TKM":"Turkmenistan","TUV":"Tuvalu","UGA":"Uganda","UKR":"Ukraine","ARE":"United Arab Emirates","GBR":"UK","USA":"US","URY":"Uruguay","SUN":"USSR","UZB":"Uzbekistan","VUT":"Vanuatu","WSB":"West Bank","DEU":"West Germany","YEM":"Yemen","YUG":"Yugoslavia","ZMB":"Zambia","ZAN":"Zanzibar","ZWE":"Zimbabwe","ENG":"England","WLS":"Wales","SCT":"Scotland","NIR":"Northern Ireland"}
